# Python_Scripting
This repository consists of scripts geared towards System Administrators; a mix of notes from online courses, real life problems 
and mentor recommendations. Python is an Object-Oriented Programming language (OOP), encourages the re-use of good code and is 
installed on many Linux distributions today by default. This makes Python an excellent choice of language for Linux SysAdmins to 
use when considering automation and scripting. 

Some of the scripts in this directory stick to basic scripting conventions without the use of OOP. For small, ad-hoc tasks, OOP 
may be overkill where a few lines of code is exceptional. But if there is any possibility that a program you are writing will be
scaled up (or out) in the future, it would be wise to consider advanced methods that allow your code to process bigger problems 
or integrate with ease.
